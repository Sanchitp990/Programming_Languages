- `<html>` : This tag represents the root element of the HTML document. It wraps all the content of the HTML document.

- `</head>` : This is the closing tag of the head section. It marks the end of the head section.

- `<body>` : This is the opening tag of the body section of the HTML document. The body section contains the main content of the HTML document, such as text, images, links, and other elements.
