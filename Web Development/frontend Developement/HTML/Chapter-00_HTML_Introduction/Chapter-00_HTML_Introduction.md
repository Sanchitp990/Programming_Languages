### HTML Syntax

The HTML syntax are given below :

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Chapter - 00 | HTML Introduction</title>
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
```

### Explanation of above html code

- `<!DOCTYPE html>` : This line declares the document type and version of HTML being used, in this case, HTML5.

- `<html lang="en">` : This line marks the beginning of the HTML document. The <html> tag defines the root element of the HTML document, and lang="en" specifies that the language used in the document is English.

- `<head>` : The `<head>` tag contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title, character set, and viewport settings. It doesn't display any content directly on the webpage.

- `<meta charset="UTF-8">` : This line specifies the character encoding for the document, in this case, UTF-8, which supports a wide range of characters from various languages.

- `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` : This line sets the viewport properties for responsive web design. It ensures that the width of the viewport is equal to the device width, and the initial zoom level is set to 1.0.

- `<title>Chapter - 00 | HTML Introduction</title>` : This line sets the title of the HTML document, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab. In this case, it's "Chapter - 00 | HTML Introduction".

- `</head>` : This line marks the end of the `<head>` section.

- `<body>` : The `<body>` tag defines the main content of the HTML document. All visible content that appears on the webpage is placed within the `<body>` tags.

- `</body>` : This line marks the end of the `<body>` section.

- `</html>` : This line marks the end of the HTML document. All HTML code must be placed between the opening `<html>` and closing `</html>` tags.
