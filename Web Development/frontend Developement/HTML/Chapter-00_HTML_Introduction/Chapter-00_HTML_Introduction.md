- `<!DOCTYPE html>` : This is a document type declaration (DOCTYPE). It informs the browser that the document is an HTML5 document. It is not an HTML tag; rather, it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the document is written in.
  
- `<html>` : This tag represents the root element of the HTML document. It wraps all the content of the HTML document.

- `<head>` : This is the opening tag of the head section of the HTML document. The head section contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as its title, links to external stylesheets or scripts, and metadata.
