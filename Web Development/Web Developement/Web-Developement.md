## Introduction
Web Development is divided into two parts such as :

- Frontend Development
- Backend Development


## Frontend Development
### What is frontend in a website :

In simple terms, the frontend of a website is like the face or the interface that users interact with when they visit a website. It's everything you see and interact with on a webpage – the layout, design, colors, fonts, buttons, forms, and any other visual elements.


### Which technologies we have to learn for frontend development :

To get started with frontend development, you'll want to learn the following technologies:

1. **HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) :** This is the standard language used to create the structure and content of web pages.

2. **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) :** CSS is used to style the HTML elements, defining how they look on the page in terms of layout, color, typography, etc.

3. **JavaScript :** JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to add interactivity and dynamic behavior to your web pages. It's essential for creating things like animations, form validation, and responding to user actions.


## Backend Development
### What is backend in a website :

In simple terms, the backend of a website refers to the part of the website that users don't see or interact with directly. It's like the engine of a car – it powers everything behind the scenes.

Backend typically includes the server, databases, and application logic. It handles tasks such as storing and retrieving data from databases, processing user inputs, managing user authentication, and serving content to the frontend (the part of the website users interact with).


### Which technologies we have to learn for backend development

To become a backend developer, you'll need to learn certain technologies. Here are some common ones:

1. **Programming Languages :** You'll need to know at least one backend programming language. Popular choices include:
- Python: Known for its simplicity and versatility.
  
- JavaScript (Node.js): Allows you to use JavaScript on both the frontend and backend.
  
- Java: Often used for large-scale enterprise applications.
  
- Ruby: Particularly popular for web development with its Ruby on Rails framework.

2. **Databases :** These are where you store and retrieve data. Some common ones are:

- SQL databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL): Good for structured data.

- NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Couchbase): Useful for unstructured or rapidly changing data.
