## Features of Python

## Difference between Python and Java

| Python                                   | Java                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Interpreted language                  | 1. Compiled language                               |
| 2. Emphasizes simplicity and readability | 2. Emphasizes object-oriented programming          |
| 3. Dynamic typing                        | 3. Static typing                                   |
| 4. Extensive standard library            | 4. Platform-independent (write once, run anywhere) |

### Code Difference between Python and Java

Here are the difference between python and java codes

In Python:

---
**code 3**
```Python
print("Hello, World!")
```

And in Java:

**code 4**
```Java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, world!");
  }
}
```
---

So, you can clearly see that difference between Java and Python to print "Hello, world!". 

The line in python to print hello world needs only 1 line but in case of java it completely change to print hello world in java we need more than 1 line as you can see in above code 4.
